### Firebase configuration

Firebase config object has been left out on purpose, you may create and connect your own Firebase project to the app though!

Once you have the config object, create `.env.development` and `.env.production` files in the project root dir and place the object as a JSON string with the key `GATSBY_FIREBASE_CONFIG`. Learn more [here](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/local-development/environment-variables/).
